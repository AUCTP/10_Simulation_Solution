# 1 - Die roll simulation  
In this block, you will simulate die rolling to practice the basics of simulation

## Task 1 - Rolling a fair die
In this task, we roll a six-sided die n times and calculate the mean outcome.

## Task 2 - Control randomness 
In this task, we want to update our program from task 1 to control the random number generation using seeds and evaluate how many tries we need to get reliable results.

## Task 3 - Make
In this task, you should should write a program to simulate the outcome of a simple betting game. In this game, a player as well as the bank roll a die. If the player has a higher number the player wins 1€. If the bank has a higher number or both numbers are equal the player loses 1€. Assume a starting capital of 100€ and evaluate how many rounds a player can play until he runs out of money. Visualize the distribution of the number of rounds played using a histogram.

# 2 - Racquetball simulation
In this task, we will develop a simulation for the game Racquetball using a Top-Down design approach.

# 3 - Roulette
In this make tasks, you want to simulate the game of (European) roulette. In this game, the table contains the numbers from 0 to 36 and each number has the same probability to be rolled. In number ranges from 1 to 10 and 19 to 28, odd numbers are red and even are black. In ranges from 11 to 18 and 29 to 36, odd numbers are black and even are red. The number 0 has the color green. 

### Task 1 - Evaluate standard betting options
In this task, we focus on two common betting options with the following payouts:
- Straight up betting on one number: Pays 35:1
- Betting on a color (red or black): Pays 1:1

Your task is to write a simulation to evaluated the expected average return of both strategies. 

### Task 2 - Evaluate the Martingale system
The Martingale system in roulette is a negative progression strategy that requires you to double your bet amount after a loss. You keep going until you finally win, and you then go back to the start. 
Example: You start with a bet of 1$ on the color red and a black number shows up. In the next turn, you bet 2$ on red. You keep doubling your bet until you finally win or hit the maximum betting amount. Evaluate if this is really a winning strategy (you can decide on the maximum betting amount allowed).
